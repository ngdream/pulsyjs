# **Getting Started with Pulsy**

Pulsy is a powerful state management library designed to be simple, scalable, and efficient. This guide will help you get started with Pulsy in your React application.

## **Installation**

To get started with Pulsy, you need to install it via npm or yarn:

```bash
# Using npm
npm install pulsy

# Using yarn
yarn add pulsy
```

## **Basic Setup**

Pulsy can be easily integrated into your React application. Follow these steps to set up your first store and use it in a component.

### **1. Create a Store**

First, create a store that will hold your application's state. Pulsy stores can be created using the `createStore` function.

```typescript
import { createStore } from 'pulsy';

// Create a store with an initial value
createStore('counterStore', 0);
```

### **2. Use the Store in a Component**

Next, use the `usePulsy` hook to interact with the store within your React components.

```typescript
import React from 'react';
import { usePulsy } from 'pulsy';

function Counter() {
  const [count, setCount] = usePulsy('counterStore');

  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Counter: {count}</h1>
      <button onClick={() => setCount(count + 1)}>Increment</button>
    </div>
  );
}

export default Counter;
```

### **3. Adding the Component to Your App**

Finally, add the component to your app.

```typescript
import React from 'react';
import Counter from './Counter';

function App() {
  return (
    <div>
      <Counter />
    </div>
  );
}

export default App;
```

Now, when you run your application, you should see a counter that increments every time you click the button. This simple example demonstrates how easy it is to use Pulsy for state management in a React application.

## **Advanced Configuration**

Pulsy also supports advanced configuration options, including persistence, middleware, and computed stores. You can configure Pulsy stores globally or for individual stores to suit your application's needs.

### **1. Persistence**

To persist store data across sessions, you can enable persistence when creating a store:

```typescript
createStore('persistentStore', 'Initial Value', { persist: true });
```

### **2. Middleware**

You can add middleware to a store to intercept and modify state changes:

```typescript
import { addMiddleware } from 'pulsy';

addMiddleware('counterStore', (nextValue, prevValue, storeName) => {
  console.log(`State change in ${storeName}:`, prevValue, '->', nextValue);
  return nextValue;
});
```

### **3. Computed Stores**

Pulsy allows you to create computed stores that derive their values from other stores:

```typescript
import { createComputedStore, usePulsy } from 'pulsy';

createComputedStore('sumStore', () => {
  const num1 = usePulsy('numberStore1')[0];
  const num2 = usePulsy('numberStore2')[0];
  return num1 + num2;
}, ['numberStore1', 'numberStore2']);
```

## **Conclusion**

Pulsy is a flexible and powerful state management tool for React. Whether you're building a small application or a large-scale project, Pulsy can help you manage your state effectively. Explore the [documentation](#) for more advanced usage and best practices.
